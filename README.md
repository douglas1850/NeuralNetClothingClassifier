# NeuralNetClothingClassifier
Followed Tensorflow guide to make a deep neural network that identifies articles of clothing with ~87% accuracy


In order to run this you'll need to download Tensorflow 1.11.0 (which contains Keras API), numpy, and matplotlib.
If you're using PyCharm just go to Preferences -> Project Interpreter -> Install : Tensorflow
This will give you TF, Keras, and numpy. You'll have to install matplotlib seperately. 

If you installed everything correctly, this program should run and display 5 epochs, final accuracy from the testing data set, 
and images from the data set accompanied by a graph representing the best classification guess by the NN for each image.
